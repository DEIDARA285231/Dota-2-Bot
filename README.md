## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users send commands (`/hero-stats` or `/matchups`) to the bot on Telegram.
2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The bot processes the command and asks for an hero name.
   - It fetches data from the Open Dota 2 API.
3. **Response**: The bot formats the data and sends it back to the user as a message.

---

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: The bot uses environment variables to securely manage sensitive information such as API keys.
- **Hero Data Source**: The bot fetches hero stats and matchup data using the Open Dota 2 API.
